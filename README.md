# LazySoundSystem
A system for allowing multiple unauthenticated users nearby to control and queue music based on a voting system.

## What is working now:
 - Get DJ Webpage with /dj/<Name>
 - Spotify API Search is exposed to the front end

## What there is to do:
 - Queue to manage songs that is based on user votes
 - Veto-ing system
 - Better UI
 - Apps to be able to share music with music apps.

### Queue
 - Should have a downvote, upvote, and veto button.
 - A User only has limited veto's.
 - There should be some weight to the votes for when they are processed


## Ideas
 - Slimer.js for Grooveshark API
 - WebApp for Queue and Voting System
 - Backed by node
 - Using IO for no server
 - 3 Vetos for everyone.. maybe?
